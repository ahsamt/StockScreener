    <h2 class="mb-3">About this project</h2>

    <p>
      This application begins to pull together the fundamental components
      required to build a stock screening tool. Such a tool can be divided into
      the following functions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        ability to download daily updates to the universe of applicable stocks
        and merge with the cache of historical data
      </li>
      <li>
        ability to run analytics on the updated historical data to search for
        specific criteria of interest
      </li>
      <li>
        ability to display to the user the stocks returned from such queries
        alongside relevant charts
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The current implementation focuses on the latter function by allowing the
      user to create a watchlist of instruments. Once an instrument is added to
      the watchlist, relevant graphs will be displayed alongside a text area to
      allow the user to keep their own notes.
    </p>
    <p>Analytics included on the graphs:</p>

    <h6 class="mb-3">Graph 1</h6>
    <p>
      The graph includes a <span class="red">20 day</span> and a
      <span class="red">50 day moving average</span>. Such analytics may be
      typically used by users to provide final decisions on whether to buy or
      sell a stock. Example of such use would include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        If the 20 day moving average crosses above (below) the 50 day moving
        average then a signal to buy (sell) may be determined.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the stock rebounds off the 50 day moving average then this may be
        considered a signal to buy.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h6 class="mb-3">Graph 2</h6>
    <p>
      The graph illustrates the movement of the stockâ€™s price versus the
      <span class="red">S&P 500 index</span>. This may prove advantageous as a
      comparison of a stock versus a relevant index, and may often be utilised
      in order to determine whether the stock is trading in an abnormal fashion
      in comparison to its peers. Leaving aside the consideration that this may
      be due to unfavourable news related to the stock, some users of a stock
      screener may anticipate the stock moving back in line with the index.
      Therefore, if the stock had dropped in value, yet the index did not, a
      user may consider buying the stock (and potentially selling the index).
    </p>
